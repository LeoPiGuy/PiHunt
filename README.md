# PiHunt
A scalable Manhunt platform to be run on Spigot minecraft servers. Supports multiple games at once and GUI based player picking.

Note That this project has been put on hold. It should work for 1.17, however future releases have not yet been tested. \
I plan to revisit this project soon bring it up to date. 

Still in development:
- 
- adding players
- prematurely ending a game
- bug fixes
